        the entire agreement between you and SHOPEASYPRO regarding this subject matter, and they govern your use of this
        Website. The failure of SHOPEASYPRO to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute

        agree that the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain
        in full force and effect. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, except in New Jersey, any claim or cause
